            <h2>Get to know us</h2>
            <p class="container"> We are a small family business from Liverpool with a passion for bringing quality taxidermy to your
                home. Our adventure started five years ago when a friend gifted us a lovely weekend getaway in Wales...
                which included taxidermy workshops. As bizarre a present as it seemed we found ourselves enjoying it
                more than expected. <br><br>
                <strong>Left:</strong> Mark. Never leaves anywhere without his sunglasses, enjoys mountain climbing.
                <br>
                <strong>Middle:</strong> Sophia. Daughter dearest, can be cheeky. Loves playing ukulele. <br>
                <strong>Right:</strong> Mary. Has the most magnificent hair. Laughs like there's no tomorrow. <br>
